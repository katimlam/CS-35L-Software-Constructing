I tested the function using a big text file which contains about
8,000,000 chars:

$ time ./sfrobu < bigfile.txt | od -ta
	real    0m10.155s
	user    0m3.143s
	sys     0m8.104s

$ time ./sfrob < bigfile.txt | od -ta
	real    0m7.533s
	user    0m2.621s
	sys     0m0.793s

$ time ./sfrobs < bigfile.txt | od -ta
	real    0m6.722s
	user    0m1.857s
	sys     0m0.850s

My test shows that sfrobs has the best perfomance, sfrob comes second, 
sfrobu comes last.
sfrobs uses scripting language and pipeline programming without any 
temporary variables. Therefore it is the fastest.
sfrob uses library function putchar() and getchar() and has moderate
performance.
sfrobu uses syscall function read() and write() which lower the
performance.

 

In the second part, I manually create file with ten lines, then copy it ten
times to 100, then to 1000 etc.

lines        comparison
10		23
100		539
1000		8540
10000		117924
100000		1489536
1000000		18013584

The relationship between lines and comparison has Big-O of 
around n(log n) base 2.
